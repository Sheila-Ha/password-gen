  ### What are the aspects of my website?
    - Character length has been designed to meet a certain criteria
    - A set of 4 prompts that will ask user preference as a guide to generate the password
    - If a criteria is not met the user starts over
    - You can chose to only have 1 criteria if you choose

  - What I learned was how to write a var, use camelCase to write a proper variable name for var to call, reading docs and researching, for loop, if statements, having the correct values, carriage return, how to debug the console for errors
